- 👋 Hi, I’m @pickwick-rudge

I'm a full-stack software developer, though these days I do back-end work.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

Learning everything I can about computers, from top to bottom. There's unfortunately limited time in life, and I simply can't remember everything, but I'm interested in learning about such varied topics as Test-Driven Development, database administration, embedded systems programming, API development, and operating system kernel development. I really admire fast, safe, and efficient programs, and that's partially what's been driving my interest in picking up Rust. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

Rust, though I'm also still interested in Python and Typescript.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Small projects that better the world in some way.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
